• What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
o Impactful- High level implementation (e.g. will we use hooks, merging something into main): vote with everyone together in stand up/ planning phase.
o Non-impactful- Lower level stuff (e.g. naming variables): handle in code review. The person writing the code should get final say in this.

• What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
o Frustration with code:
 If you’re currently pair programming or working in a group: take a break.
 If you’re working solo: individual trouble shooting should at least involve googling an error and/or console logging. (exception: the issue is impactful)
o Frustration with team dynamic:
 Consider whether you are frustrated about an impactful decision or a non-impactful.
 It is possible that something was mis-classified as non-impactful when it is impactful.
 Bring it up in stand up, but there is flexibility. If work is brought to a stand-still you should be able to ask to call the team together.
 Make a point to support suggestions with evidence. This keeps us focused on the arguments rather than the people.
 Stay focused on solutions. If someone doesn’t seem to be pulling their work perhaps we need to provide space to ask underlying permission

• What does this group do when we merge our work together?
o This will presumably be lead by the gitmaster?
o Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?
o The FIRST merge should be done together so everyone can review as a group in a merge party.
o Maybe we set aside 1 hour at the end of every day to review pull requests. We can change this if there is nothing ready to merge.

• When does this group ask for help?
o Do basic trouble shooting individually: google the error, console log stuff, etc. If 30 min of that isn’t getting any results then….
o Put an @here to the group to get help from a team mate. If the team mate cannot help you then…
o Do a help ticket.

• How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
o We will put in time on grooming to make sure we are all aligned in our strategy.
o That should make it so we can code individually pretty efficiently.
o However if we run into an issue where we are stuck and basic trouble shooting and googling is not getting us answers then we can do an @here to get help from another team members.

• How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
o Don’t expect to be able to get support from the team members after hours.
o Be available to interact with team members during working hours (with some exceptions if you let the team know about it)
o If you are able to get your work done, then there shouldn’t be a requirement to work after hours.
 There should be grace to be make a case for while a certain task turned out to be much larger than anticipated when it was assigned.

• What time does this group have daily stand up?
o 10:30am-10:45am EST
o What is covered in stand up for each person:
 What have you accomplished.
 What are you working on.
 What’s in your way.

• Grooming will take a good deal longer, and we will do it separately.
o This will be lead by the task master. Lane has volunteered to be our first task master.
o Organizing the kan ban board is a part of them.
o Take soft detail (e.g. a mock up without any code) and turn it into tickets (i.e. bite sized piece of coding)
o What needs to be done.
o Who will work on what, and when
o What is the priority.
